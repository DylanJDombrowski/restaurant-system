When adding a pizza to order in PizzaCustomizer.
    select a size, the thin crust option should be selected by default so that the toppings are immediately shown. 
    the price is not being updated based on added prices etc as of now, at least on the frontend .
    the stuffed crust option should not display. we have a stuffed pizza (which is a deepdish. completely different pizza than thin or double dough),
        the stuffed pizza will be under the stuffed category.
    toppings should take up less space, see more, and active toppings by default (our special pizzas) will show those active toppings at the top of the toppings list.
    
what schemas can i show you for better context. i think we desperately need documentation for the current state of things and where we are and where we are not'

-- 1. Exact table structures
SHOW CREATE TABLE crust_pricing;
SHOW CREATE TABLE pizza_templates;  
SHOW CREATE TABLE pizza_template_toppings;

-- 2. Current variant/crust relationships
SELECT id, menu_item_id, name, crust_type, size_code, price 
FROM menu_item_variants 
WHERE menu_item_id IN (SELECT id FROM menu_items WHERE item_type = 'pizza')
LIMIT 10;

-- 3. How stuffed pizzas are separated
SELECT * FROM menu_categories;
SELECT name, category_id FROM menu_items WHERE name ILIKE '%stuffed%';

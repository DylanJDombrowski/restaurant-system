Add performance indexes
Set up Row Level Security policies


API Middleware Implementation

Tenant resolution middleware
Rate limiting for enterprise scale
Audit logging for compliance
Proper error handling



Medium Priority (Next 2 Weeks)

Feature-Based Architecture

Reorganize components into feature modules
Create shared component library
Implement proper dependency injection


Multi-Tenant Support

Tenant context provider
Subdomain routing
Brand customization system



Longer Term (Next Month)

Performance & Monitoring

Add application monitoring
Implement caching strategies
Database query optimization
Load testing framework



🚀 Quick Wins You Can Implement Today
1. Clean Up Your Current Types
Start by creating the new type structure I showed above. You can gradually migrate your existing code to use the new types.
2. Add Basic Tenant Context
Add a simple tenant provider that wraps your app:
typescript// src/app/layout.tsx
import { TenantProvider } from '@/lib/tenant/tenant-context'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <TenantProvider initialTenant={/* resolved from middleware */}>
          {children}
        </TenantProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
3. Implement the Enterprise Homepage
The homepage I created above would be a great starting point. You can customize it with your actual branding and add real demo links.
4. Add Basic API Middleware
Start with the tenant middleware - this will make all your APIs multi-tenant ready immediately.
🎯 Key Enterprise Considerations

Scalability: Your current pizza customizer is good, but think about handling 100+ restaurants with different menu configurations
Security: Multi-tenant data isolation is critical
Performance: Database indexes and query optimization for large datasets
Compliance: Audit trails, GDPR compliance, PCI DSS for payments
Monitoring: Application performance monitoring, error tracking
Documentation: API docs, deployment guides, troubleshooting

The type system reorganization should be your first priority - it will make everything else cleaner and more maintainable. Then focus on the database schema improvements since they'll support all the enterprise features you'll build later.
